Single Quotes:  Characters within single quotes are treated literally.  Bash interprets them exactly as you typed them, regardless of their usual meaning in commands. This includes special characters like spaces, dollar signs ($), asterisks (*), etc.

Double Quotes:  Characters within double quotes are generally interpreted literally, but some special characters have a special meaning:

Variable Expansion: Double quotes allow for variable expansion. If a dollar sign ($) is followed by a variable name within double quotes, Bash will replace it with the value of that variable.
Escape Sequences: Certain backslash () combinations within double quotes have special meanings. For example, \n represents a newline character, \t represents a tab character, etc.
