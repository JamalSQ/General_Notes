For making a crone job the process is as follows:

Enter the server using your credentials then use this command

First, check:

=>which crone				//this will tell you the path (/usr/bin/curl) copy that path and paste it into the next command that is mentioned
=>crontab -e 			//it will open a file with some text that will be commented write this command at the end of the file 

Syntax:
=>	* * * * * /usr/bin/curl -s Command/URL

For example: 
=>	* * * * * /usr/bin/curl -s http://64.210.13.241/folder_name/file_name/function_name
instead of this (http://64.210.13.241/folder_name/file_name/function_name) there may be any other command that you want to run after specific time like print "hello world"; etc

Now the crone job is established it will execute it after every minute

NOTE:
if you do not understand the above command then search for it, especially the stars.
