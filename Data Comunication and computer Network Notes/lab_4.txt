HOW TO REMOVE THE VLAN


//Remove Specific Vlan
Command : 
 (config)#no vlan 2			// 2 means second no vlan remove 
(config)#sh flash				//show database of the vlan

//Remove All Vlan in prevelidged mode
Command:
delete  ?			//give option
delete vlan.dat		// get confirmation and then say yes and delete


// For making Trunk   
//why trunk   =>    for carring  the multiple switch lan's 
			  =>	    instead using two switch using one switch by making two lan's in one switch of 						different network to connect

switch(config)#interfac fa0/24
switch(config)#switchport mode trunk		//only communicate within the its vlan
