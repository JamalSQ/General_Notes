										System calls
when we write the program in gcc then we have to call it through system call.
syntax ?

command
=>  man(manual)		write

=> we write code in "C" language
=> For write command we use header file 

 #include<unistd.h>
int main(){

}

=>	we write on screen or on file 
=>   ubuntu take everything/ read everything as a file.

=>write(int fd,buf,size)

paramters explanations					
=>file discriptes(fd)		[0=>"keyboard",	1=>"for screen/showing output",		2=>"error"]         (built-in define)	//where read and where write ,where to write
=>buf(buffer)			       small part of data of RAM in buffer that give data in a short time.			 // what is data	,	what to write
=>size					       length of words,characters    which we are going to read					//size of write



**********For writing and execution of the program****************
(1)		nano news.c
(2)		write code

PROGRAMM
 #include<unistd.h>
int main(){
write(1,"hello world",11);		//we are going to write on screen(1),msg	,  character of the msg
}

(3)		gcc new.c
(4) 		./a.out

**********For reading and execution of the program****************
(1)		nano read.c
(2)		read code

PROGRAMM
 #include<unistd.h>
int main(){
char buf[50];
read(0,buf,20);		//we are going to write on screen(1),msg	,  character of the msg
write(1,buf,20);
}

(3)		gcc new.c
(4) 		./a.out
