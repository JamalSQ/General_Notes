Pipes (output of one process is used as input for another)
used for inter-process communication
Architecture used: Pipes and Filters

one process uses a pipe to pass its data to other process.

input --> filter --> pipe --> filter --> output

sort command is practical example of this architecture.

grep command is used apply filters.

| sign for pipes


cat filename | less (scroll through arrow) or more (scroll through enter key). // integrate pipelines

cat filename | grep -i anyWord // filter file content based on anyWord.



#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
//                          (writing end of pipe) 1-------------0 (reading end)
creating parent-child processes
int fd[2]; // containing 1 and 0 for write and read
int n;
char buffer[20];
Pid_t p;

p = fork();
if(p>0){
prinf("parent will write on process");
else
{
"child will read from process");}

// write sys call
write(fd[1], "data", 4);
// read sys call
n = read(fd[0],buffer,20);
// writing on screen
write(1,buffer,n);
}
